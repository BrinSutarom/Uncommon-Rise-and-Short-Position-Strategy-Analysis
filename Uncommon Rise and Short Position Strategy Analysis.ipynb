    "# Uncommon Rise and Short Position Strategy Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis explores how uncommon rises in the NASDAQ index (symbol: `NQ=F`) could signal profitable short positions. The analysis considers the behavior of the 5-day percentage change in adjusted closing prices and identifies the points at which the percentage change exceeds a defined threshold. The strategy aims to enter short positions following these uncommon rises and exit when the market drops significantly. \n",

    "- Simulate short positions by entering after a rise and exiting at the most profitable drop.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis indicates that entering short positions following uncommon rises in the NASDAQ index can be a profitable strategy. Several instances have shown significant price drops within days of entering a short position, supporting the effectiveness of this strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insights:\n",
    "- On average, it takes **2.12 days** to enter a short position.\n",
    "- On average, it takes **5.12 days** to exit a short position.\n",
    "- The average maximum drop in price during this period is **-3.18%**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests that the strategy of shorting after uncommon rises is effective in capturing downward price movements over a relatively short time frame."
